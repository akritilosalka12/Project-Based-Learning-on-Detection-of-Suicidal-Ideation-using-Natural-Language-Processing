# Project-Based-Learning-on-Detection-of-Suicidal-Ideation-using-Natural-Language-Processing
This repository contains a Project-Based Learning Seminar presentation on detecting suicidal ideation from social media posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The study explores how social media data can be leveraged to identify individuals at risk, facilitating early intervention and mental health advocacy.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Objective: Develop an NLP-based approach for detecting suicidal ideation from social media posts.
Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression
Dataset: Text data from platforms like Reddit (SuicideWatch, Depression)
Key Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy
ðŸ“Š Methodology
Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Text cleaning (removing special characters, stopwords, and lemmatization)
Tokenization using NLP techniques
Feature representation with Word2Vec and GloVe
Model Training & Evaluation:
Logistic Regression trained on labeled suicidal/non-suicidal text
Performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy
Results:
Achieved an F1-score of 0.9162 and accuracy of 0.9225
Addressed challenges like false positives, data biases, and ethical concerns
